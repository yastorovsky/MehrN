>**Youtube safe search** and **live streaming** are now **Bypassed & Working** by default. so you don't need `youtube_via_relay` or Cloudflare / VPS `exit_node` for it.

**❤️ Special Thanks to** [Abolix](https://github.com/abolix) for making this project possible and maintaining it.

MasterHttpRelayVPN is a local proxy that routes browser traffic through a Google Apps Script relay using domain fronting. The simple path needs only this project and a free Google account. For sites that block Google egress, you can optionally add an exit node later.

We mainly use MITM (Man in the Middle) and Domain Fronting techniques.

## Fast Start ⚡

Before running the local proxy, deploy the Google relay once. You only need a Google account and about two minutes.

## Deploy The Google Relay ☁️

1. Open [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/) and sign in.
2. Click **New project**.
3. Delete the default editor content.
4. Open [apps_script/Code.gs](apps_script/Code.gs), copy everything, and paste it into Apps Script.
5. Find this line and replace it with your own long secret:

    ```javascript
    const AUTH_KEY = "your-secret-password-here";
    ```

6. Click **Deploy** -> **New deployment** -> **Web app**.
7. Set **Execute as** to **Me**.
8. Set **Who has access** to **Anyone**.
9. Click **Deploy**, approve the permission screen, and copy the **Deployment ID**.

Keep these two values ready for the setup wizard:

- `Deployment ID` from Google Apps Script
- `AUTH_KEY`, a long secret that must match `auth_key` in your local config

If you want more detail, use [Getting Started](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md#2-deploy-the-google-relay).

Download the project with either Git or ZIP, then run the one-click launcher.


**Option A: ZIP**

[Click to Download](https://github.com/masterking32/MasterHttpRelayVPN/archive/refs/heads/python_testing.zip)


**Option B: Git**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/masterking32/MasterHttpRelayVPN.git
cd MasterHttpRelayVPN
```


Then start the app:

**Windows**

```cmd
start.bat
```

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

The launcher creates a virtual environment, installs dependencies, opens the setup wizard if `config.json` is missing, and starts the proxy.

After it starts, configure your browser to use:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Proxy type | HTTP |
| Address | `127.0.0.1` |
| Port | `8085` |
| SOCKS5 port | `1080` |

After starting, CA will be installed automatically.

You can use telegram as : https://t.me/socks?server=127.0.0.1&port=1080 or if you are using PC client, you can add HTTP proxy with manually.

## Common Next Steps 🛠️

- If the browser shows certificate warnings, open [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#certificate-errors).
- If you see `unauthorized`, make sure `AUTH_KEY` in [apps_script/Code.gs](apps_script/Code.gs) exactly matches `auth_key` in `config.json`.
- If ChatGPT, Turnstile, or similar sites block the Google exit IP, use [Exit Node Guide](docs/exit-node/EXIT_NODE_DEPLOYMENT.md).
