## Features

### Connection
- Import and manage subscription links and supported share links.
- One-click Windows system proxy control with exceptions and PAC support.
- Optional TUN mode to route device traffic through the selected profile.
- Per-subscription update controls in Subscription Settings.
- ⛓️ **Proxy Chain (Double Tunneling):** chain two configs together pick a middle (entry) server and an exit server and the app routes traffic `local -> middle -> exit` entirely client-side, no server-side setup needed (Xray / sing-box). 

### Cores
The portable release bundles ready-to-run runtimes — no separate core download needed:

| Core | Use |
| ---- | --- |
| Xray | VLESS / VMess / Trojan / Shadowsocks, including Reality and XTLS |
| sing-box | Modern protocols including Hysteria2, TUIC, WireGuard |
| mihomo | Clash Meta–compatible rule-based routing |
| Aether | Censorship circumvention (MASQUE, WireGuard, pluggable transports) |
| 🔥 SNI Spoofing | DPI bypass with IP/TCP-header manipulation no server needed |
| 🛟 MHR Relay | Domain-fronted relay via Google Apps Script only a free Google account needed |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **🛡️ Shutdown & emergency ready:** SNI Spoofing and MHR are built for
> heavily filtered networks, throttling, and partial / full internet shutdowns —
> when normal profiles and servers stop working, these modes can keep you connected.
>
> - **SNI Spoofing:** bypasses DPI by manipulating IP/TCP headers. No subscription or VPS required.
> - **MHR:** routes traffic through your own Google Apps Script relay with domain fronting
>   (`Browser -> Local proxy -> Google front -> Your Apps Script relay -> Target site`);
>   the network filter only sees a Google-facing connection. Optional Cloudflare / VPS exit node for sites blocking Google IPs.

**Only in MehrON: a combination of advanced censorship circumvention tools such as [SNI Spoofing](https://github.com/patterniha/SNI-Spoofing/tree/main) and [MHR](https://github.com/masterking32/MasterHttpRelayVPN)**


> [!TIP]
> Official portable releases ship with the `bin/` core binaries and up-to-date
> `geoip.dat` / `geosite.dat` routing databases already in place — no extra
> downloads are needed before first connect.

### Routing and DNS
- Visual routing rules editor with bypass / proxy / direct presets.
- DNS settings with hijack and FakeIP support.
- SNI spoofing engine and MHR relay are configured from the Cores section above.

### Settings for everyone
- Option settings are grouped by topic (connection, core, system proxy, TUN, appearance…).
- **Novice mode:** turn off *Show advanced settings* on top of the Option window
  to hide Fragment, MUX, update sources, and advanced TUN options.

### Test and maintain
- Profile latency / speed test with configurable endpoints.
- Server statistics, subscription auto-update, backup and restore.
- Beta update channel with automatic update checks.

## Quick start (portable release)

The portable Windows package is distributed as `MehrON-windows-64.zip`
(one archive — no nested zips).

1. Extract the archive to a writable folder.
2. Run `MehrON.exe`.
3. Accept the Windows administrator prompt when using TUN mode or other features that require elevated permissions.
4. Import a profile or add a subscription link.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> TUN mode installs a virtual network adapter and needs administrator rights.
> If you only use the system proxy mode, elevation is not required.

The release intentionally contains no saved profiles, subscriptions, logs, or generated runtime configuration files.

## Build from source

Requirements:

- Windows
- .NET SDK 10.0 (see `global.json`)

Build the WPF desktop client from the repository root:

```powershell
dotnet build .\v2rayN\v2rayN\v2rayN.csproj -c Release
```

The output is written to `v2rayN\v2rayN\bin\Release\`.

> [!NOTE]
> Runtime binaries are not produced by the .NET build. A portable release must
> include the required Xray, sing-box, mihomo, and Aether files beneath its
> `bin` directory before it can run standalone.
